    "A and C are weakly correlated (probably this is the result of two opposing tendencies: Formation of A depletes mutual intermediate B, leading to a negative correlation, but formation of A and C is confounded by formation of B, leading to a positive correlation). Particularly, we only see C if we also see A. This makes sense when considering the first point. Basically, we get (some) A whenever B forms. Intramolecular cyclization does not outcompete oxidative decarboxylation sufficiently to shut down formation of A."
