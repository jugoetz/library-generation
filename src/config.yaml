    # - "outer_wells": source plate has all compounds in A/H rows (for better visibility)
    #   the order is such it increases A1->A12->H1->H12, but we leave wells free to avoid cross contamination.
    #   Precisely, the 16 initiators occupy A1-A9, A11, and all odd wells in row H,
    #   the 12 monomers fill all odd wells in rows A and H
    #   the 10 terminators fill all odd wells in row A and all odd wells in H1-H8
  # - "canonical_order": compound I10 is in the 10th well (i.e. A10) and so on
